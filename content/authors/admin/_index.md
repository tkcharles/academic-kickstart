Tessa Charles is a lecturer of accelerator physicist. 
Her research interest include nonlinear dynamics and beam optics design in particle accelerators.
In particular, this includes: beam optics design, Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) 
cancellation techniques,
particle trajectory caustics (relating to bunching dynamics, current spikes formation and 
microbunching instability)
